## Instructions

Thank you for taking the time to continue the interview process for a Regions UX Engineer Role.

Below you’ll find instructions for an exercise designed to help us understand your approach to writing HTML and CSS. If you have any questions during this process, please don’t hesitate to reach out to Ben Tonak at ben.tonak@regions.com.

Exercise

We’d like you to build a simple landing page for a fake site called “World Traveler.” This one-pager is small in scope, but we’d like you to approach it as if what you build will be re-used across many sites or platforms.

Please match the design intent, consider approaches to responsive behavior, and consider how the elements could be extended or reused in other contexts. As much as you can, create scalable patterns and conventions and limit your use of a framework, such as bootstrap. We want to understand how you think and how you approach a project, so when you’re done we’ll take a look at your work and then have a conversation about it with you.

Due Date

Please don’t spend more than 2-3 hours on this. Please email your solution back to us 2 days before our scheduled follow up time with you.

Assets

We’ve attached a ZIP file that contains the landing page design and supporting assets:

design.html This file is our way of sending design specs to you. Once opened in the browser, you’ll be able to click on elements to see most of their styling attributes. We made this in Sketch with a plugin called Sketch Measure. So, this file is just a screenshot of an artboard with a bunch of meta data overlaid. It’s not meant to be used for any sort of HTML jumping point for you.

img folder This folder contains three static images, presented in the design.

google-fonts-snippet.txt The fonts used in the design is Source Sans Pro (300, 400, 600, and 700). To load those fonts, you can add this snippet to the head of your document.

Submission

You can use CodePen, or a similar online tool, to develop your solution. Then send us a link when you’re done. If you prefer to code locally, you can submit a ZIP via email or send a link to Github (or GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

Thank you for your time, we look forward to seeing your work!
